## ðŸš€ Quick start


## Start developing.

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    cd npm run develop
    ```
##  Open the source code and start editing!

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    *Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
